## TITLE OF THE STUDY

SportsHub: A Progressive Web Application for Athlete Records and Sports Activity Management System

---

## ABSTRACT

This study aims to design and implement SportsHub, a Progressive Web Application (PWA), for Surigao del Norte National High School (SNNHS). The main motivation for this project is the lack of a proper system for tracking sports activities and athlete records in the school. Right now, the school has already started organizing sports clubs, but all the records are still being managed manually. This leads to disorganized data, difficulty in monitoring athlete participation, and poor coordination of events.

The proposed system has three main parts: a public-facing landing page, an athlete dashboard, and an administrator dashboard. The landing page is where students can browse posted announcements and submit an application form to express interest in joining a sport. Announcements are published by the portal itself whenever the Sports Coordinator schedules a new event, so the public page always reflects the live schedule without a separate announcement workflow. As part of the application, students are required to confirm their eligibility by submitting a medical certificate, a birth certificate, and a signed parent's consent form. No account is created at this stage. The administrator then reviews submitted applications inside the admin dashboard, verifies each uploaded document, and decides whether to approve, reject, waitlist, or return the application for further documents. If a student is approved, the admin creates an official athlete account by entering the student's name, email, student ID, assigned sport, and login credentials. The generated temporary password forces the athlete to set a personal password on first login. From the athlete dashboard, they can view their schedules, events, announcements, attendance records, achievements, notifications, coach information, and application status, check in to open attendance sessions, request achievement certificates, and update profile details. The administrator dashboard provides the Sports Coordinator with full tools to manage sports programs, athlete accounts, coach assignments, event scheduling, a shared calendar, attendance sessions, medical records and injury incidents, achievements, certificate requests, and printable reports, all in one centralized platform.

The project follows a Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach covering planning, prototyping, feedback, finalization, and a formal evaluation phase. Once completed, the system is evaluated based on usability, reliability, and performance efficiency using the ISO/IEC 25010 quality standard. The developed system is backed by an automated feature test suite and is expected to improve data organization, reduce the time spent on manual recording, and make it easier for both students and administrators to access and manage sports-related information.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The lack of a proper system for tracking sports activities and athlete records in Surigao del Norte National High School makes it difficult to manage sports programs, monitor athlete participation, and organize events. This study aims to design and develop a SportsHub for the school to make sports management more organized and easier to handle. At present, the school has already started forming sports clubs, but there is still no system in place to manage records properly. Because of this, information is often scattered, and it becomes hard to keep track of athletes and scheduled activities.

Sports programs are very important for students because they help improve physical fitness, teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills. In many schools, sports-related information like player lists, schedules, and event records are still handled manually using paper or simple spreadsheets. While this method works to some extent, it can lead to errors, repeated data, and even loss of important information. It also takes more time to update records and find needed data, especially when there are many participants involved. That is why many schools are now starting to use digital systems to make their processes faster and more efficient.

In the case of Surigao del Norte National High School, the absence of a proper sports management system affects how sports clubs and activities are organized. Without a centralized platform, administrators and coaches find it challenging to monitor participation, manage events, and keep records updated. This can lead to confusion, missing information, and poor planning of activities. Developing SportsHub can help solve these problems by giving the school a single system where all sports-related data can be stored and managed properly.

This study focuses on developing and testing SportsHub, a web-based Progressive Web Application that can handle sports records, athlete information, coach assignments, event scheduling, attendance tracking, medical clearances, achievements, and certificates. The system is expected to make data more organized, reduce manual work, and make it easier for users to access information. It can also generate CSV and PDF reports that will help in monitoring sports activities and making better decisions for future programs.

This study aims to answer the following research questions:

- What problems are currently being experienced in managing sports activities and athlete records in Surigao del Norte National High School?
- How can a web-based SportsHub improve the management of sports activities and athlete records?
- How effective is the proposed system in terms of usability, reliability, and performance efficiency?
- What improvements can be suggested for the future development of the system?

### 1.1 Project Context

This project was conceptualized in response to the lack of an organized system for managing sports activities and athlete records in Surigao del Norte National High School (SNNHS). Although the school has started forming sports clubs and conducting activities, most of the records are still handled manually or written in simple lists. Because of this, it is difficult for coaches and coordinators to keep track of athletes, monitor participation, and manage schedules properly.

The project is set within the school's sports management environment, where different activities such as trainings, intramurals, and club events are regularly conducted. These activities require proper planning and organized records to run smoothly. However, without a digital system, information can become unorganized or incomplete, making it harder to retrieve when needed. This situation affects how sports programs are planned and managed in the school.

This project is important because it supports the school's move toward using technology to improve its processes. By developing SportsHub, the school can have a centralized system where all sports-related data is stored and managed in one place. This will make it easier for administrators and coaches to access information, update records, and organize activities more efficiently.

In addition, the project can benefit the entire school community by improving how sports programs are monitored and managed. With a more organized system, records will be more accurate and easier to maintain. This system can also serve as a foundation for future improvements and possible expansion to other school systems.

### 1.2 Purpose and Description

The purpose of this project is to create SportsHub, a Progressive Web Application that will help Surigao del Norte National High School (SNNHS) organize and manage its sports activities more effectively. Since the school currently does not have a proper system for tracking sports, athletes, and events, this project aims to provide a simple and organized digital solution that can replace manual recording.

The system is made up of three main parts. The first is a public-facing landing page that any student can access without logging in. On this page, the school’s Sports Coordinator can publish announcements such as recruitment drives, tryout schedules, and upcoming events. These announcements are produced by the portal itself: as soon as an event is created and scheduled, SportsHub automatically publishes a matching announcement on the landing page, and the announcement is automatically withdrawn if that event is later cancelled or postponed. This removes the risk of a public notice contradicting the live schedule. Students who are interested in joining a sport can fill out and submit an application form directly from this page. To ensure eligibility, the application requires the submission of a medical certificate, a birth certificate, and a signed parent’s or guardian’s consent form. No account is created at this point — the form simply sends the student’s information and documents to the admin for review.

Student eligibility is verified through documentary requirements submitted alongside the application form. A student must provide a valid medical certificate issued by a licensed physician confirming that they are physically fit to participate in sports activities, a birth certificate issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) to confirm age and identity, and a duly signed parent’s or guardian’s consent form authorizing the student’s participation in school sports programs. Applications that are incomplete or missing any of these documents will not be processed for approval. These requirements are intended to protect the health and safety of student-athletes and ensure that all participants meet the school’s standards for sports participation.

The second part is the administrator dashboard, which is accessible only to the Sports Coordinator or authorized Admin. After a student submits an application, the admin can view all applicants inside the dashboard and move each one through a structured review workflow. The workflow tracks the application as Pending, Under Review, Documents Required, Approved, Rejected, or Waitlisted, and it also records the state of each of the three uploaded documents separately as Submitted, Verified, or Rejected. The coordinator can request missing documents, record review notes, and attach a rejection reason, all of which become visible to the student on the "My Application" page. If a student is approved, the admin creates an official athlete account by entering the student's name, email, student ID, assigned sport, and login credentials. The system generates a one-time temporary password and flags the account so that the athlete is required to set a personal password before reaching any other screen.

The third part is the athlete dashboard, which is the personal space for officially registered athletes. From here, athletes can view their schedules, upcoming sports events, posted announcements, a shared calendar, their attendance records, their achievements, and their coach’s information. They can check in to attendance sessions that are open on the current day, request an official certificate for an achievement they have earned, review the status and feedback of their application, and update profile details such as their contact number, emergency contact, and profile photo. Since the admin controls account creation, only verified and approved athletes can access this dashboard, making the system more secure and easier to manage.

Overall, the project is designed to make sports management in the school more organized, secure, and efficient for both athletes and administrators. It also serves as a starting point or foundation that can be improved and expanded in the future if needed.

### 1.3 General Objectives of the Study

This study aims to design and implement a web-based SportsHub for Surigao del Norte National High School to improve the management and organization of sports activities.

Specifically, it aims to:

- Gather data on the current sports management practices and challenges at Surigao del Norte National High School (SNNHS) through informal observation and the researchers’ personal experience as former student-athletes, in order to identify the functional requirements of the proposed SportsHub.
- Design and develop a web-based Progressive Web Application (SportsHub) that provides a centralized platform for managing athlete records, sports programs, coach assignments, event scheduling, attendance monitoring, medical records, achievements and certificates, and announcements at SNNHS using PHP 8.2, Laravel 12, MySQL, and Tailwind CSS 4.
- Test and evaluate the developed system using the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Quality Model in terms of usability, reliability, and performance efficiency among selected SNNHS respondents, and provide recommendations for future system improvement based on the evaluation results.

### 1.4 Scope and Limitations

**Scope**

- The system covers three main user interfaces: a public-facing landing page, an athlete dashboard, and a restricted administrator dashboard accessible only to the Sports Coordinator.
- The landing page allows any student to view announcements, browse the available sports programs, and submit a sports application form. To be eligible to join a sport, students must submit a medical certificate, a birth certificate, and a signed parent’s or guardian’s consent form as part of their application. No account is created at this stage. Announcements are published automatically by the portal when a scheduled event is created, and are withdrawn automatically when that event is cancelled or postponed.
- The administrator can review, approve, reject, waitlist, or return submitted applications for further documents, verify or reject each uploaded document individually, and record review notes and rejection reasons visible to the student.
- Approved applicants are converted into official athlete accounts with an assigned sport, a username, and a one-time temporary password that the athlete must replace on first login.
- Registered athletes can log in to view their schedules, events, calendar, announcements, attendance records, achievements, application status, coach information, notifications, and the members of their own sports program, and can update profile details, check in to open attendance sessions, and request achievement certificates.
- The administrator dashboard manages sports programs, athlete accounts, coach assignments, event schedules, attendance sessions, medical records and injury incidents, achievements, certificate requests, and downloadable reports.
- The administrator can choose the scope of a downloaded athlete list — either the whole school or a single sport program — and can export the athlete, coach, attendance, and per-athlete attendance reports in CSV or PDF format.
- Attendance is tracked through attendance sessions that may belong to a scheduled event or stand alone. The roster of each session is derived automatically from the athletes assigned to the session’s sport, so no manual roster selection is required. A configurable late grace period separates a Present check-in from a Late one, and cancelled sessions are excluded from attendance-rate calculations.
- Medical records track examination results, clearance status, uploaded medical certificates with expiry monitoring, and scheduled check-ups. Injury incidents are recorded separately per athlete with severity, treatment, rest period, return-to-play date, and medical clearance, so that a new examination never overwrites an injury history.
- The system is delivered as an installable Progressive Web Application with a web app manifest and a service worker that caches the application shell and falls back to a dedicated offline page when the network is unavailable.
- The system will be evaluated using the ISO/IEC 25010 quality standard covering usability, reliability, and performance efficiency, with fifteen (15) respondents from SNNHS including the Sports Coordinator, faculty sports advisers, and student-athletes.

**Limitations**

- The system does not include financial management, student grading features, or integration with any external platforms such as a Learning Management System (LMS) or other school information systems.
- A dedicated native application for Android or iOS is not part of this study. As a Progressive Web Application (PWA), the system is accessible through any standard web browser on any device, including smartphones, tablets, and laptops, without requiring additional software installation.
- The evaluation will be conducted exclusively at SNNHS, and the results may not be generalizable to schools with different operational contexts, infrastructure, or resource availability.
- The accuracy of athlete records depends entirely on the administrator who manually inputs data; the system has no automated data validation against external school databases.
- The offline capability is a caching convenience rather than a full offline mode. Read-only screens remain browsable from the cache when the connection drops, but server-backed operations — submitting an application, checking in to a session, or approving a document — still require an active internet connection. Credentials and records are never stored on the device.

## 2. RELATED LITERATURE

### Foreign Literature

Hao et al. (2024) designed a web-based college sports events management information system integrating event release, registration, race scheduling, and performance management using front-end and back-end separation architecture with Ajax and RESTful API technology. The system resulted in fast data transmission and significantly improved user satisfaction. However, the system targets higher education institutions and does not address implementation needs of secondary-level schools with limited technical infrastructure in developing countries like the Philippines. This gap underscores the need for a more accessible, school-level sports activity management system such as the one proposed for SNNHS.

Ma et al. (2024) developed a college student sports performance management system demonstrating that digitized sports records significantly reduced manual workload and improved data accuracy. Nevertheless, the study was confined to higher education, and no equivalent pilot system has been developed for senior high school sports programs. This gap calls for a comparable but simplified digital system tailored for secondary schools like SNNHS.

Sun (2020) presented a school sports management system based on web technology that automated attendance, sports data recording, and physical education management, significantly reducing administrative burden and improving record accuracy. Despite these contributions, the study did not address the integration of student registration, intramural scheduling, and real-time results tracking in a unified hub — core functions needed in a comprehensive school sports activity system.

Wang and Park (2021) developed an intelligent sports training management system for college students using deep learning and Browser/Server architecture. Results showed that 64% of students increased their weekly exercise frequency. However, the complexity and cost of AI-driven systems present challenges for implementation in resource-limited secondary schools. The current study addresses this gap by proposing a simpler, cost-effective web-based system appropriate for a public senior high school.

Zhang et al. (2021) proposed an optimized sports event management system integrating registration, scheduling, score recording, and report generation in a single platform for improved coordination efficiency. Nonetheless, the study focused on professional sporting events and did not consider operational constraints of school-level intramural sports management. The proposed SNNHS system fills this void by addressing the specific logistical and resource realities of a public secondary school.

Zhu (2025) introduced an Intelligent Sports Management System integrating wireless sensor networks and neural networks for real-time monitoring, injury prediction, and administrative reporting. However, the system requires advanced IoT hardware and high-speed network connectivity, making it impractical for deployment in public high schools with constrained infrastructure.

Jastrow et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review of digital technology use in physical education from 2009 to 2020, finding that digital media served as effective motivational tools. The review identified a significant gap in research on digital tools specifically designed for after-school and extracurricular sports management — an area directly addressed by the proposed SportsHub at SNNHS.

Zhong et al. (2025) conducted a comprehensive systematic review on digital-intelligent technologies in physical education, finding that 86% of digital implementations occurred in formal PE classes while after-school sports activity applications accounted for only 5% of cases. This directly points to the need for systems like the SportsHub that support organized extracurricular sports participation at the secondary school level.

Martín-Rodríguez and Madrigal-Cerezo (2025) reviewed technology-enhanced pedagogy in physical education and emphasized that successful digital implementation requires alignment with educational objectives. A key gap identified was the lack of research on simple, low-cost digital platforms suitable for sports activity management in secondary schools — a gap the current study seeks to fill.

Li et al. (2022) proposed an IoT-assisted physical activity monitoring system demonstrating improvements in student physical activity outcomes. However, high costs of IoT infrastructure pose barriers to adoption in public secondary schools. The proposed SNNHS system circumvents this barrier by relying exclusively on web-based, device-agnostic technology requiring no additional hardware.

Xu et al. (2024) found that user readiness is as critical as the technology itself in digital sports tool adoption, suggesting that culturally responsive design matters greatly. This study addresses the gap by designing a user-friendly, culturally responsive system suited to Filipino senior high school students.

Sang and Wang (2022) demonstrated high data integrity in a fitness monitoring system using IoT and blockchain technology. No comparable system exists for secondary school populations in the Philippine context, reinforcing the urgency of developing even a foundational digital system for SNNHS.

Haffner et al. (2025) identified that most sports digitalization studies focus on single-stakeholder effects, calling for ecosystem-level research. This justifies developing a hub-based system that addresses multiple user roles. The proposed system is explicitly designed to serve students, coaches, coordinators, and administrators simultaneously.

Qi et al. (2024) cautioned that over-reliance on automated systems without adequate human oversight could diminish coaching expertise. This finding highlights the importance of designing sport hubs that augment rather than replace the roles of teachers and sports coordinators — a guiding principle in the design of the SNNHS system.

Swim et al. (2023) argued that digital literacy is a core competency in sport management education, supporting the integration of a SportsHub at SNNHS where students gain early exposure to digital sports management systems.

### Local Literature

The Department of Education (2023) issued Memorandum No. 005, s. 2023, known as the "Sports for All" policy, which mandates all DepEd schools to conduct organized sports competitions and maintain comprehensive documentation of student sports participation. However, most schools, including SNNHS, currently rely on manual and paper-based processes that make compliance monitoring difficult. The proposed SportsHub directly addresses this compliance gap by automating documentation and sports record-keeping.

The Department of Education (2024) introduced a Sports Activity Management course under the Strengthened Senior High School Curriculum. A functional digital SportsHub at SNNHS would directly support the documentation, scheduling, and evaluation components required by this curriculum, enhancing learners’ practical engagement with the subject.

Cagas et al. (2022) reported in the 2022 Philippine Report Card on Physical Activity that 84.5% of Filipino adolescents fail to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity. A centralized SportsHub at the school level would provide a structured platform to increase sports participation and monitor student activity engagement at SNNHS.

The Philippine Sports Commission (2023) emphasized that schools serve as primary venues for talent identification and physical fitness promotion. Local studies confirm that school-level sports programs lack digital tools to track, document, and report sports participation systematically. This gap in school-level digital infrastructure motivates the development of the proposed SNNHS SportsHub.

Cullarin-Bernales (2021) found significant challenges in coordinating and administering school sports programs and recommended a prototype sports management framework. However, the prototype did not incorporate digital tools, leaving a gap in automated data management. The SNNHS system fills this gap by providing a fully digital, web-based management solution.

Pestano and Ibarra (2021) highlighted the critical need for organized monitoring tools and documented tracking of student-athlete performance across competition levels — needs that the proposed SportsHub is specifically designed to address.

Cipriano et al. (2024) recommended digital administrative tools to support sports program governance and monitoring in educational institutions. This recommendation validates the core purpose of the SNNHS SportsHub as a governance and monitoring tool.

Butlig et al. (2023) recommended structured institutional systems for managing student-athlete schedules and academic monitoring — functions that the proposed hub integrates into a single digital platform.

Campo et al. (2024) identified that digital tools specifically for physical sports activity management and extracurricular sports coordination remain underdeveloped in the Philippine context, providing strong justification for developing the SNNHS SportsHub as a locally responsive digital solution.

Galindo et al. (2024) recommended comprehensive strategies including better scheduling and monitoring systems to help student-athletes balance their dual roles. This recommendation aligns directly with the scheduling and monitoring functions built into the proposed SNNHS system.

Umali (2025) recommended that schools institutionalize organized sports programs supported by clear administrative and documentation frameworks to sustain the developmental benefits of school sports. The proposed hub operationalizes this recommendation through a structured, digitally supported sports management environment.

## 3. Technical Background

The SportsHub is a web-based information system that will be used to coordinate sports activities, athlete records, coach assignments, event scheduling, attendance, medical clearances, achievements, and certificates at Surigao del Norte National High School (SNNHS). The system is developed using widely used and well-supported web technologies that are appropriate for an educational development project.

**Frontend Technologies.** The user interface is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, which are the current standards in web development. HTML5 is used to create the structure of the pages, CSS3 handles the visual layout and styling, and JavaScript manages client-side interactions. The styling approach combines **Tailwind CSS 4**, compiled through the Vite 7 build pipeline, with a **hand-authored design system** published as static assets in `public/css/`. The design system is defined through a single set of CSS custom properties in `theme.css` — covering the school primary colour, the accent orange, neutral surfaces, and semantic status colours for present, late, absent, excused, and pending — and consumed by `portal.css`, `landing.css`, and `sportshub.css`. This token-based approach gives both portals and the public landing page one consistent visual language, and it supports a light and dark theme that the user can switch and that the system remembers between visits. Reusable interface components such as the confirmation dialog, the password-reset modal, the avatar, the notification bell, and the collapsible sidebar are implemented as shared partials and scripts rather than repeated markup, so that behaviour stays consistent across every module.

**Backend Technologies.** The server-side logic of the application is written in PHP 8.2, a popular scripting language that is well-suited for web-based applications in school or institutional settings. PHP handles user requests, processes form submissions, validates uploaded documents, and communicates with the database. **Laravel 12** is used alongside PHP to follow an MVC (Model–View–Controller) structure that separates the user interface from the database operations. Laravel's service container is used to keep cross-cutting logic out of the controllers — the attendance session service owns roster generation and check-in rules, the certificate service owns the single official certificate layout, the notification service owns targeted fan-out, and the security service owns failed-password warnings. Blade templates handle the view layer, Laravel's validation and authentication features handle input safety, and database notifications give every portal an in-app notification feed. This division of responsibility makes the system easier to develop, manage, and maintain.

**Database Management.** MySQL is the relational database management system (RDBMS) that stores and manages all system data, including sports programs, athlete profiles, coach records, event schedules, attendance sessions, medical records, achievements, and certificate requests. It is a good fit for this project because of its strong compatibility with PHP and Laravel, and its support for structured queries like filtering, searching, and generating reports. The schema is created and versioned through Laravel migrations, and the data is accessed through the Eloquent ORM, which expresses the relationships between entities — a sport has many athletes, coaches, and events; an event has many attendance records; an athlete has many achievements — as declarative model associations backed by foreign key constraints.

**Document and Report Output.** Official documents are generated server-side rather than through the browser's print dialog. The **dompdf** library renders achievement certificates, attendance session reports, and school reports directly into PDF files, and the same report payloads are streamed as CSV when a spreadsheet format is requested. This guarantees that a downloaded certificate is identical for every recipient and carries an official reference number, and it lets the coordinator export a filtered roster for documentation without leaving the portal.

**Progressive Web Application Support.** SportsHub is delivered as a Progressive Web Application so that it can be installed on a phone or desktop and still open quickly on a weak connection. The application ships a web app manifest that defines the application name, theme colour, display mode, and icon, together with a hand-written service worker. The service worker precaches the application shell, serves navigation requests network-first, stores successful responses in a runtime cache, and falls back to a dedicated offline page when the network is unavailable. A lightweight registration script loads the worker without blocking the page.

**Development Environment.** The system is developed and tested locally using XAMPP as the local server environment on a Windows machine, with MySQL as the database server and the application served through Apache. Visual Studio Code is used as the primary code editor, and Git is used for source code versioning, allowing the development team to track changes, manage revisions, and maintain a stable codebase. The application is configured for the Philippine Standard Time zone so that all recorded timestamps — session dates, check-in times, publication dates, and medical check-up schedules — are interpreted consistently for the school's own calendar.

### 3.1 Conceptual Framework

The SportsHub is guided by the Input–Process–Output–Evaluation (IPO-E) model, which shows how raw data entered into the system will be transformed through a series of operations into organized outputs that support sports management at SNNHS, and then assessed through a formal evaluation phase. As shown in Figure 1, the framework is made up of four main components: Input, Process, Output, and Evaluation, all supported by the system's technology stack and directed toward the central goal of the project.

**Figure 1. Conceptual Framework (IPO-E Model) — SportsHub, SNNHS**

The **Input** component consists of all data that will be provided by the Administrator or Sports Coordinator, together with the documents submitted by the public. This includes sports program details, student-athlete profiles, coach information, event schedules, medical examination findings, injury incident reports, achievement records, and login credentials. From the public side, the input consists of the application form and its three supporting documents — a medical certificate, a birth certificate, and a signed parent’s or guardian’s consent form. These inputs are meant to replace the informal paper-based records currently used at SNNHS.

The **Process** component covers the core operations of the system, such as adding, editing, deleting, and viewing records; verifying documents; approving or rejecting applications; scheduling events; generating attendance sessions and their rosters; recording attendance and check-ins; tracking medical clearance and check-up schedules; recording achievements; approving and issuing certificates; sending notifications; searching and filtering data; and generating reports. All of these are executed through a PHP Laravel backend connected to a MySQL database.

The **Output** component represents the results that the system will produce: an organized athlete registry, a coach directory, an event calendar, printable participation and attendance reports, official achievement certificates in PDF form, an in-app notification feed for both athletes and coordinators, and an administrative command centre that gives coordinators an at-a-glance view of all sports data — total athletes, active sports programs, upcoming events, sessions open for check-in, pending applications, achievements and medals recorded, and the current attendance rate.

The **Evaluation** component measures the quality of the system outputs using the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Quality Model, specifically assessing the system in terms of usability, reliability, and performance efficiency based on structured feedback from fifteen (15) SNNHS respondents. The evaluation is supported by an automated feature test suite that exercises every major module — applications, attendance, events, achievements, certificates, medical records, notifications, and the two password workflows — so that functional reliability is verified continuously alongside the user-facing survey.

The system will be built using PHP 8.2 and Laravel 12 for the backend, Tailwind CSS 4 with a token-based CSS design system for the frontend interface, and MySQL for structured data storage. Together, these components will work as an integrated platform that provides SNNHS with a centralized, efficient, and accessible digital solution for managing school sports activities, replacing the disorganized manual practices that currently make it difficult for coaches and coordinators to track athlete participation and event schedules.

## 4. METHODOLOGY

This project will follow the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology because of its emphasis on quick prototyping and iterative user feedback, which is well-suited for developing a web-based management system within an academic timeframe. The RAD model will allow the development team to move quickly from requirements gathering to design, receive feedback early, and make improvements before finalizing the software. This approach helps minimize development risks and keeps the project closely aligned with the real needs of Surigao del Norte National High School.

The RAD methodology was also chosen because the project scope is clearly defined and the intended users, specifically the school administrator and sports coordinator, are accessible for feedback and validation throughout the development process. The four main phases of RAD applied in this study are: (1) Planning Requirements, (2) Prototype, (3) Receive Feedback, and (4) Finalize Software, followed by system evaluation.

**Figure 2. Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model**

### 4.1 Planning Requirements

The planning phase will focus on identifying the functional and non-functional requirements of the SportsHub. Instead of relying solely on formal interviews or surveys, the requirements for this project are largely based on the personal experience of the researchers as former student-athletes in a Philippine public high school setting, particularly in schools similar to SNNHS in terms of context and available resources.

As former student-athletes, the researchers have personally experienced the challenges of manually managed sports programs. Records of sports participation were often written on paper or encoded in basic spreadsheets, making it difficult to find information when needed. Coach assignments were communicated informally, and event schedules were posted on bulletin boards or shared through word-of-mouth. Athletes frequently missed or forgot upcoming events because there was no centralized notification or scheduling system in place. These real-life experiences provided a grounded and realistic basis for defining what the system needs to accomplish.

To support this experiential foundation, the researchers also conducted informal observation of the current sports management practices at SNNHS. Through these observations, it was confirmed that the school had already started organizing sports clubs but continued to rely on manual documentation. Coaches and coordinators were found to have difficulty consolidating records, tracking which athletes were active, and keeping event information up to date. These observations helped validate the requirements identified through the researchers’ personal experience and gave additional context specific to SNNHS.

Based on these inputs, the following key requirements were identified for the SportsHub:

- Update limited profile information and change the account password

*Public (No Login Required):*

- View the public landing page and browse posted announcements and available sports programs
- Submit a sports application form to express interest in joining a sport, including the required eligibility documents: a medical certificate, a birth certificate, and a signed parent’s or guardian’s consent form (no account created at this stage)
- Eligibility requirements for joining a sport: (1) Medical Certificate — issued by a licensed physician certifying the student is physically fit for sports participation; (2) Birth Certificate — PSA-issued document confirming the student’s age and identity; (3) Parent’s or Guardian’s Consent Form — a signed document authorizing the student to participate in school sports activities. Incomplete submissions will not be processed.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

- Usability: The interface must be simple and intuitive for non-technical users such as coaches and school administrators, with a consistent sidebar navigation and a light or dark theme
- Reliability: The system must consistently perform operations without data loss or error, verified through an automated feature test suite
- Performance Efficiency: Pages and operations must load within acceptable response times under a normal internet connection, with each dashboard figure resolved by a single aggregate query rather than repeated per card
- Security: Data must be accessible only to authorized users through login authentication; athlete-facing queries are scoped to the signed-in account so that one athlete can never read or act on another’s records
- Privacy: Eligibility documents, medical certificates, and issued certificates are stored on private storage and are released only through authorized routes
- Accessibility: The system must be accessible via standard desktop or laptop browsers without requiring additional software installation, and must remain readable on smaller screens
- Offline tolerance: Previously loaded screens must remain browsable through the service-worker cache when the connection drops, with a clear offline page as the final fallback

These requirements will serve as the foundation for the system's design and development, making sure that the SportsHub addresses the real and observed needs of SNNHS rather than generalized assumptions.

### 4.2 Prototype

After identifying the system requirements, a low-fidelity prototype will be developed to visualize the layout and workflow of the SportsHub before actual coding begins. The prototype will be created using Figma, a widely used interface design tool that allows for quick creation of wireframes and mockup screens. The main goal of this phase is to establish a shared visual understanding of the system among the development team and to present an early preview to the target users for initial feedback.

The prototype will cover all major modules of the system and will follow a clean and minimal design approach to ensure ease of navigation, especially for school administrators and coaches who may not be very familiar with digital management tools. The design will be guided by a single set of design tokens for colour, spacing, and status indication, which will later be applied in the actual front-end implementation.

The following screens will be included in the prototype, organized by user role:

*Public / Landing Page Screens:*

- **Landing Page** — the public homepage accessible to all students without logging in. It will display posted announcements, an overview of available sports programs, and a button to submit a sports application
- **Application Form Page** — a form where interested students can submit their eligibility requirements and personal details including name, student ID, grade level, gender, sport of interest, medical certificate, birth certificate, and signed parent’s or guardian’s consent form. No account or password is created here — the form only sends their application and documents to the admin for review
- **Login Page** — a single login screen for both Admin and Athletes, redirecting each user to their respective dashboard based on their role
- **Forgot / Reset Password Pages** — screens for requesting a password reset link and for setting a new password from that link

*Athlete Dashboard Screens:*

- **Athlete Dashboard** — the main screen for logged-in athletes showing attendance summary, sessions open for check-in, upcoming schedules, recent achievements, and quick links to other sections
- **Sports Programs** — the list of active sports programs with member counts, a program member directory, and an individual member profile
- **My Schedule** — displays the athlete’s training sessions, competitions, and other assigned sports events
- **Calendar** — a month view of all scheduled sports activities, filterable by sport, venue, event type, and status
- **Announcements Page** — shows all active announcements posted on the landing page
- **Attendance Record** — displays the athlete’s personal attendance record and rate, upcoming attendance sessions, and the check-in control for sessions open that day
- **My Achievements** — the athlete’s medals, titles, and awards with a timeline, and the control to request an official certificate for an achievement
- **My Application** — the status of the sports application together with the review notes or rejection reason given by the coordinator
- **Coach Info Page** — shows the name, specialty, coach type, and contact details of the athlete’s assigned coach
- **My Profile Page** — shows the athlete’s account details with the option to update limited information such as contact number, emergency contact, and profile photo, and to change the password

*Admin Dashboard Screens:*

- **Admin Dashboard** — a command-centre summary showing total athletes, total sports programs, upcoming events, today’s sessions, pending applications, total achievements, medals awarded, and the current attendance rate, together with pending items and recent activity
- **Applications Management** — a list of all submitted student applications with options to approve, reject, waitlist, request documents, and verify or reject each document
- **Sports Management** — screens for adding, editing, and viewing sports programs
- **Athlete Management** — a list and management screen for all registered athlete accounts, including eligibility status and password reset
- **Coach Management** — a form and directory for managing coach records and sport assignments
- **Event Scheduling** — an event creation form and table view of all scheduled sports activities
- **Calendar** — a shared month view of all scheduled activities across sports programs
- **Attendance Management** — a module for creating attendance sessions, opening and closing them for check-in, and recording or overriding athlete attendance per session
- **Medical Records** — screens for athlete medical examinations, clearance status, medical certificates, check-up schedules, and injury incidents
- **Achievements** — screens for recording achievements for athletes or teams and for generating the official certificate
- **Certificate Requests** — a queue of athlete certificate requests with approve, generate, release, and issue actions
- **Reports Module** — a report interface for generating and downloading athlete, coach, attendance, and per-athlete attendance summaries in CSV or PDF

Each screen will be annotated with notes explaining the intended behavior of buttons, form validations, and navigation links. This will help the development team stay aligned during the coding phase and give the school stakeholders a clear preview of the system before any development resources are fully committed.

### 4.3 Receive Feedback

Once the prototype is completed, it will be presented to selected stakeholders for review. The goal of this phase is to gather constructive feedback from people who are most likely to use or be affected by the system before actual development begins. This will help the team identify any design issues, missing features, or improvements that need to be addressed early on.

The prototype walkthrough will be conducted with at least two or three faculty members involved in sports management at SNNHS, along with a small group of student-athletes who represent potential end-users. The researchers will guide them through each module of the prototype, explaining the purpose of each screen and how the features are intended to work. After the walkthrough, the participants will be asked to share their thoughts and suggestions through an informal feedback form or a short structured questionnaire.

Feedback will be focused on the following key areas: clarity and ease of navigation, completeness of features based on the school’s actual needs, the overall layout and design of the interface, and any additional functions that the participants feel should be included. All feedback gathered will be documented and reviewed by the development team.

Based on the feedback received, the team will revise the prototype and update the system requirements if needed before moving on to the actual development phase. This iterative process is one of the key strengths of the RAD methodology and will help ensure that the final system is well-aligned with the real needs of the school community.

### 4.4 Finalize Software

After incorporating the feedback gathered from the stakeholder prototype review, the development team will proceed to finalize and build the SportsHub as a fully functional web-based system. This phase will involve the actual coding, integration of all system modules, internal testing, and preparation of the system for user evaluation. The finalization phase will follow the technical design established during the prototype stage and will apply the revisions identified during the feedback phase.

The system will be developed using the following technologies and tools:

**Frontend Development:** The user interface will be built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, with Tailwind CSS 4 compiled through Vite and a hand-authored CSS design system published as static assets in `public/css/`. The design system defines the primary and accent colours, neutral surfaces, status colours, and dark-mode values as CSS custom properties in `theme.css`, which are then consumed by `portal.css`, `landing.css`, and `sportshub.css`. A shared inline SVG sprite supplies the interface icons, and small focused scripts handle only behaviour that the server cannot provide — sidebar collapse, theme switching, confirmation dialogs, relative timestamps, profile photo handling, and form enhancements — so the pages remain fast and usable with scripting disabled for their core content.

**Backend Development:** The server-side logic will be written in PHP 8.2 using the Laravel 12 framework. Laravel’s MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture will be used to separate business logic from presentation, resulting in a well-organized and maintainable codebase. Laravel’s built-in authentication, validation, and notification features will be used to implement secure login functionality for the Administrator and Sports Coordinator. Dedicated services will carry the cross-cutting rules: attendance session creation, roster synchronization, and check-in; achievement certificate generation; notification fan-out with de-duplication; and failed-password warning dispatch.

**Database Management:** All system data, including sports programs, athlete profiles, coach records, event schedules, attendance sessions, medical records, achievements, and certificate requests, will be stored and managed using MySQL. Laravel’s Eloquent ORM will be used to perform database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, as well as filtering and generating reports. The schema is maintained through versioned migrations so that every structural change to the system is recorded and reproducible.

**Document and Report Generation:** Official achievement certificates, attendance session reports, and school reports are produced server-side as PDF documents using the dompdf library, and the same report data is streamed as CSV for spreadsheet use. Certificates carry a unique official reference number and are signed by the Sports Coordinator and the School Principal, and the same certificate layout is used whether the certificate is generated directly by the coordinator or issued through an athlete’s certificate request.

**Security Implementation:** Athlete access to personal records is enforced at the query level through model scopes that always receive the authenticated account rather than an identifier supplied by the browser, so an athlete can never widen a result to another athlete’s rows. Eligibility documents, medical certificates, and issued certificates are stored on private storage and are streamed only through authorized routes. Failed sign-in attempts are recorded and reported to the account holder and to every Sports Coordinator by email, with the alerts throttled and the identifier masked so that the login form cannot be used to discover which accounts exist. The password reset flow uses a single-use, time-limited link with rate limiting and returns the same generic response whether or not an address is registered.

**Progressive Web Application Packaging:** A web app manifest and a hand-written service worker will be shipped with the system. The service worker precaches the application shell and static assets, serves navigation requests network-first, stores successful responses in a runtime cache, and falls back to a dedicated offline page, so that previously loaded screens remain browsable even when the school’s connection is unreliable.

**Development Environment:** The system will be developed and tested locally using XAMPP as the local server environment on a Windows machine, with MySQL and Apache provided by the same server stack. Visual Studio Code will be used as the primary code editor throughout the development process.

**Version Control:** Git will be used for source code versioning, allowing the development team to track changes, manage revisions, and maintain a stable codebase throughout the development process.

The finalized system will include the following modules organized by role:

**Public Landing Page:** The entry point of the system accessible to all students without logging in. It will display active announcements, an overview of available sports programs, and a button to submit a sports application.

**Application Form Module:** A public form where interested students can submit their eligibility requirements and personal details including name, student ID, grade level, gender, sport of interest, medical certificate, birth certificate, and signed parent’s or guardian’s consent form. No account is created at this stage — the submission is simply stored and forwarded to the admin for review.

**Login, Authentication, and Password Recovery Module:** A single login page that authenticates both Admin and Athlete accounts. Users are redirected to their respective dashboards based on their assigned role. A self-service password reset delivers a single-use link by email with a 60-minute expiry and rate limiting, and an administrator-assisted reset issues a one-time temporary password that the athlete must replace before reaching any other screen.

**Applications Management Module (Admin):** Allows the admin to view all submitted student applications, review individual entries, verify or reject each uploaded document, request missing documents, and approve, reject, or waitlist the application. Review notes and rejection reasons are recorded and shown to the student.

**Create Athlete Account Module (Admin):** After approving an application, the admin fills out a form to create the official athlete account. Fields include name, email, student ID, assigned sport, username, and a one-time temporary password that triggers a forced password change on first login.

**Sports Management Module (Admin):** Allows the admin to add, edit, view, and delete sports programs with fields for program name, classification, gender grouping, status, description, and logo.

**Athlete Management Module (Admin):** Enables management of all registered athlete accounts including name, assigned sport, status, eligibility, contact details, and emergency contact, and provides an action for resetting an athlete’s password.

**Coach Management Module (Admin):** Manages coach information including name, specialty, coach type, sport assignment, contact details, status, and profile picture.

**Event Scheduling Module (Admin):** Supports creation and management of sports events including training sessions, tournaments, tryouts, intramural competitions, and matches. Each event entry includes title, description, type, start and end date, venue, assigned coach, sport, status, and notes. Creating a scheduled event automatically publishes the matching landing-page announcement.

**Calendar Module (Admin and Athlete):** A shared month view of all scheduled activities, with filters for sport, venue, event type, and status, and with events displayed on every day of their span.

**Attendance Management Module (Admin):** Allows the admin to create attendance sessions that either belong to a scheduled event or stand alone, generate the session roster automatically from the athletes assigned to the session’s sport, open and close sessions for check-in, record or override each athlete’s status, cancel sessions, and export the session as CSV or PDF.

**Medical Records Module (Admin):** Records examination dates, medical findings, restrictions, clearance status, next check-up dates, and uploaded medical certificates, with an automatic certificate state of Valid, Expiring Soon, Expired, or Missing. Injury incidents are recorded per athlete with severity, treatment, rest period, return-to-play date, and clearance, and records can be archived and restored rather than deleted.

**Achievements Module (Admin):** Records achievements for individual athletes or teams, linked to the relevant sport and event, with a type such as a gold, silver, or bronze medal, a championship title, an individual award, or participation, and generates the official printable certificate.

**Certificate Requests Module (Admin and Athlete):** An athlete requests a certificate for an achievement earned; the coordinator approves the request, generates the PDF certificate, releases it, and issues it, after which the athlete can download it from the Achievements page. A request may also be rejected with a reason.

**Notifications Module (Admin and Athlete):** An in-app notification feed surfaced through a bell in the portal header, with unread counts, individual and bulk read actions, and targeted delivery to the whole school or to the athletes of a specific sports program.

**Reports Module (Admin):** Generates athlete, coach, attendance, and per-athlete attendance summaries filterable by sport, date range, status, and other criteria, downloadable in CSV or PDF, with the administrator able to choose whether an athlete list covers the whole school or a single sports program.

**Athlete Dashboard:** The personal homepage for logged-in athletes showing an attendance summary, sessions open for check-in, upcoming activities, recent achievements, and quick navigation links.

**Sports Programs (Athlete):** The list of active sports programs with member counts, a member directory, and an individual member profile.

**My Schedule (Athlete):** Displays the athlete's assigned training sessions, competitions, and events.

**Calendar (Athlete):** Displays the athlete's scheduled activities in the shared month view.

**Announcements Page (Athlete):** Shows all active announcements posted on the landing page.

**Attendance Record (Athlete):** Displays the athlete's personal attendance record and rate, and provides the check-in control for sessions open on the current day.

**My Achievements (Athlete):** Displays the athlete's medals, titles, and awards with a timeline, and allows the athlete to request an official certificate.

**My Application (Athlete):** Displays the status of the sports application together with the coordinator's review notes or rejection reason.

**Coach Info (Athlete):** Shows the name, specialty, coach type, and contact details of the athlete's assigned coach.

**My Profile (Athlete):** Shows the athlete's account details with the option to update limited information such as contact number, emergency contact, or profile photo, and to change the account password.

Internal testing will be conducted by the development team using both manual testing procedures and an automated feature test suite covering every major module. Test cases will be designed to verify that each module performs its intended functions correctly, that form validations work as expected, that authorization rules prevent one athlete from reaching another athlete's records, and that data operations such as creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval produce accurate results. Identified bugs will be documented and resolved prior to the formal system evaluation phase.

The finalized system will be deployed to a local server environment accessible via a web browser on desktop and laptop devices, and will then be prepared for formal evaluation by school stakeholders in accordance with the ISO 25010 quality standards applied in the evaluation phase.

### 4.5 Evaluation Methods and Tools

To assess the quality and effectiveness of the SportsHub, the development team conducted a structured system evaluation using the ISO/IEC 25010 Software Quality Model as the primary evaluation framework. ISO 25010 is an internationally recognized standard for evaluating software product quality. For this study, three quality characteristics were selected as evaluation criteria based on their relevance to the system's purpose and the profile of its intended users: Usability, Reliability, and Performance Efficiency.

Usability was evaluated to determine how effectively and efficiently the Sports Coordinator and administrators could navigate and operate the system without needing technical training. Reliability was assessed to measure the system's ability to perform its intended functions consistently and without data loss or operational errors during regular use. Performance Efficiency was examined to determine whether the system responded to user actions within acceptable time limits under a standard internet connection.

The primary evaluation tool was a structured questionnaire based on a five-point Likert scale, with response options ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). The questionnaire was divided into three sections corresponding to the three ISO 25010 quality characteristics. A total of fifteen items were included: five items for Usability, five for Reliability, and five for Performance Efficiency. The questionnaire was developed by the research team and validated by the research adviser before administration.

The evaluation was conducted among a total of fifteen (15) respondents from Surigao del Norte National High School, consisting of the school's designated Sports Coordinator, three faculty members who serve as sports advisers for school clubs, and eleven student-athletes representing different sports categories. The respondents were given access to the finalized web-based system and were asked to interact with all major modules before completing the questionnaire. A brief orientation was provided to make sure respondents understood the purpose of the evaluation and the nature of each questionnaire item.

In addition to the Likert-scale questionnaire, the evaluation also included direct observation by the development team during the testing session. Observations focused on how easily respondents navigated the system, any technical errors that occurred during testing, and the overall responsiveness of the system under the school's network conditions. Observational notes were used to supplement and give context to the quantitative data collected from the questionnaire.

Quantitative data collected from the questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics, specifically the weighted mean for each evaluation criterion and the overall weighted mean across all items. The computed weighted mean scores were interpreted using the following scale:

| Range | Verbal Interpretation | Quality Level |
|---|---|---|
| 4.50 – 5.00 | Strongly Agree | Excellent |
| 3.50 – 4.49 | Agree | Very Satisfactory |
| 2.50 – 3.49 | Neutral | Satisfactory |
| 1.50 – 2.49 | Disagree | Needs Improvement |
| 1.00 – 1.49 | Strongly Disagree | Poor |

**Table 1. Likert Scale Interpretation for ISO 25010 Evaluation**

The results of the evaluation were used to determine whether the SportsHub met the quality standards required for practical deployment in a school setting. Findings from both the questionnaire and direct observations are discussed in the Results and Discussion section of this study to provide a comprehensive assessment of the system's performance.

## 5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

This section presents the planned outcomes and design outputs of the SportsHub, organized according to the major components of the development process. These include project planning, systems design, system implementation, and system evaluation. Each subsection provides a detailed description of what the development team intends to accomplish and deliver at each phase of the project.

### 5.1 Project Planning

The project planning phase will establish the overall direction, timeline, and resource allocation for the development of the SportsHub. A structured project timeline will be developed to guide the development team throughout all stages of the software development lifecycle, from initial requirements gathering to the final system presentation. Proper planning will ensure that all development activities are organized, trackable, and achievable within the constraints of the academic capstone schedule.

The development team will use a Gantt chart as the primary project planning tool to map out the key phases and activities of the project across a twelve-month development timeline. The Gantt chart will provide a visual overview of task sequencing, phase overlaps, and milestones, allowing the team to monitor progress and make schedule adjustments as needed throughout the project.

The project will be divided into six major phases: (1) Planning, which covers requirements gathering, stakeholder consultation, and scope definition; (2) System Design, which includes the development of wireframes and system diagrams; (3) Development, which encompasses the frontend, backend, and database implementation; (4) Testing and Feedback, which involves user testing and iterative revisions; (5) Finalization, which covers final revisions and documentation; and (6) Presentation, which includes the final defense and submission of the capstone document. The timeline for each phase is illustrated in the Gantt chart below.

| Phase | Tasks / Activities | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1: Requirements Planning | Gathering, Stakeholder Consultation, Scope Definition | █ | █ | | | | | | |
| Phase 2: Prototype & System Design | Prototype (Figma), Use-Case, Class, Sequence Diagrams | | █ | █ | █ | | | | |
| Phase 3: Development | Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS/Tailwind), Backend (PHP/Laravel), Database (MySQL) | | | | █ | █ | █ | | |
| Phase 4: Testing & Feedback | User Testing, ISO 25010 Evaluation, Questionnaire, Bug Fixes | | | | | | █ | █ | █ |
| Phase 5: Finalization | Final Revisions, Documentation, Deployment Preparation | | | | | | | █ | █ |
| Phase 6: Presentation | Final Defense, Submission of Capstone Document | | | | | | | | █ |

**Table 2. Project Gantt Chart — SportsHub Development Timeline (2025–2026)**

Resource allocation for the project will primarily involve the two members of the development team, who will share responsibilities across all phases. During the planning and design phases, both researchers will focus on requirements analysis and prototype development. During the development phase, tasks will be divided based on each member's technical strengths, with one member focusing primarily on frontend implementation and the other on backend logic and database management. Testing and documentation responsibilities will be shared equally throughout the project.

The tools and resources required for the project include a laptop with internet access, XAMPP for the local server environment, Visual Studio Code for coding, Figma for prototype design, MySQL for database management, and Microsoft Word for documentation. All tools are freely available or open-source, making the project feasible within the limited budget of an academic capstone study.

### 5.2 Systems Design

The systems design phase will produce the technical blueprints that will guide the development of the SportsHub. Three standard system modeling tools will be used to represent the structural and behavioral aspects of the system: the Use-Case Diagram, the Class Diagram, and the Sequence Diagram. Each diagram will address a different dimension of the system architecture and will provide the development team with a clear specification of the system's expected behavior, data structures, and interaction flows.

#### a.) Use-Case Diagram

The Use-Case Diagram illustrates the interactions between the system's three distinct actor groups and the use cases assigned within a clearly defined system boundary. Each actor operates exclusively within their designated boundary to prevent overlapping responsibilities: the Public (unauthenticated) actor interacts only with the public-facing landing page; the Admin/Sports Coordinator actor operates only within the secured administrator dashboard; and the Athlete actor is restricted to the personal athlete dashboard. No use case is shared across boundaries, ensuring clean separation of roles and system access.

Any student visiting the landing page (no login required) can:

- View Announcements posted by the system when a scheduled event is created
- Browse available Sports Programs
- Submit a Sports Application Form to express interest in joining a sport. No account is created at this point.
- Reset a Forgotten Password through a single-use emailed link

The Admin/Sports Coordinator actor has full access to the administrator dashboard and can perform the following use cases: Log In using secure credentials; View and Manage Student Applications by verifying or rejecting documents and approving, rejecting, or waitlisting; Create Official Athlete Accounts for approved applicants by providing their name, email, student ID, assigned sport, username, and a temporary password; Reset an Athlete's Password; Manage Sports Programs; Manage Athlete Profiles and Accounts; Assign and Manage Coaches; Schedule and Manage Sports Events; View the shared Calendar; Record and Manage Attendance Sessions; Manage Medical Records and Injury Incidents; Record Achievements and Issue Certificates; Review Certificate Requests; Send Notifications; Generate Reports; and Log Out.

The Athlete actor represents an officially registered athlete whose account was created by the admin. Athletes can: Log In using their assigned credentials and set a personal password on first login; View their personal Athlete Dashboard; View their Schedules, Calendar, and assigned Events; View posted Announcements; View their personal Attendance Records and Check In to an open session; View their Achievements and Request a Certificate; View their Application Status and Feedback; View their Coach's Information; Browse their Sports Program Members; Update limited Profile Information; Change their Password; and Log Out.

**Figure 27. Use-Case Diagram — SportsHub**

The diagram clearly shows three non-overlapping sections within the system boundary, each corresponding to one actor group. The Public boundary contains only the landing page interactions; the Admin boundary contains all administrative management use cases; and the Athlete boundary contains only the athlete-facing dashboard features. This structured separation ensures that no use case is duplicated across actor groups and that the system boundary clearly delineates which functions are accessible to each role, preventing ambiguity and overlap in system design.

#### b.) Class Diagram

The Class Diagram will model the data structure of the SportsHub by representing the key entities of the system, their attributes, and the relationships among them. The diagram is based on the planned database schema in MySQL and the Eloquent ORM relationships that will be defined in the Laravel framework.

The system will consist of thirteen primary entities: User, Sport, Coach, Application, Announcement, Event, AttendanceSession, Attendance, MedicalRecord, MedicalIncident, Achievement, CertificateRequest, and Notification. The **User** class represents both the Sports Coordinator (role Administrator) and the officially registered athlete (role Student) in a single authenticated table, with attributes such as id, name, email, username, password, role, status, sport_id, student_id, phone, grade_level, emergency contact details, profile_photo_path, and must_change_password. The **Sport** class represents a sports program with attributes including id, name, classification, gender, description, status, and logo_path. The **Coach** class stores coach information with attributes such as id, name, email, phone, specialty, coach_type, sport_id, status, and profile_picture_path. The **Application** class stores the details of student application forms submitted from the landing page before any account is created, with attributes such as id, name, student_id, grade, gender, email, sport_id, the three document paths with their individual document statuses, status (Pending, Under Review, Documents Required, Approved, Rejected, or Waitlisted), rejection_reason, review_notes, documents_requested, and review_history. The **Announcement** class represents posts published on the landing page, with attributes such as id, title, body, published_at, status, and event_id. The **Event** class manages scheduled sports activities with attributes including id, title, description, venue, starts_at, ends_at, status, sport_id, event_type, coach_id, team_name, max_participants, and notes. The **AttendanceSession** class represents a session for which attendance is taken, with attributes including id, event_id, sport_id, title, venue, description, session_date, start_time, end_time, late_grace_minutes, status, created_by, opened_at, and closed_at. The **Attendance** class records an athlete's attendance within a session, with attributes such as id, attendance_session_id, event_id, user_id, status (Present, Late, Absent, Excused, or Pending), attended_on, and check_in_time. The **MedicalRecord** class stores examination results with attributes such as id, athlete_id, examination_date, medical_status, next_checkup_date, findings, restrictions, notes, medical_certificate, and archived_at. The **MedicalIncident** class stores per-athlete injury history with attributes such as id, athlete_id, sport_id, incident_date, activity, injury_type, body_part, severity, description, treatment, rest_period_days, return_to_play_date, and medical_clearance. The **Achievement** class records a medal, title, or award with attributes such as id, athlete_id, team_name, sport_id, event_id, title, description, achievement_type, competition, place, date_achieved, and certificate_path. The **CertificateRequest** class tracks an athlete's request for an official certificate with attributes such as id, achievement_id, student_id, status (Pending, Approved, Issued, or Rejected), remarks, handled_by, handled_at, certificate_path, certificate_generated_at, and certificate_reference. The **Notification** class stores the in-app messages delivered to administrators and athletes, with attributes such as id, type, notifiable_type, notifiable_id, data, read_at, and timestamps.

The key relationships in the system are as follows: a Sport has many Athletes, many Applications, many Announcements (through events), many Coaches, many Events, many Attendance Sessions, and many Achievements. A User (athlete) has many Attendance records, many Medical Records, many Medical Incidents, many Applications, and many Achievements. A Coach belongs to a Sport and has many Events. An Event belongs to a Sport and a Coach, and has many Attendance Sessions, many Attendance records, and many Achievements. A MedicalRecord belongs to an Athlete and has many Medical Incidents. An Achievement belongs to an Athlete (or names a team), a Sport, and an Event, and has many Certificate Requests. All of these relationships will be implemented as foreign key constraints in MySQL and managed through Eloquent model associations in the Laravel backend.

**Figure 28. Class Diagram — SportsHub**

The Class Diagram will serve as the primary reference for structuring the MySQL database schema and defining the Eloquent model relationships in the Laravel application. It will ensure consistency between the database design and the application logic throughout the development phase.

#### c.) Sequence Diagram

The Sequence Diagram will describe the order of messages exchanged between the actors, the Laravel request handlers, and the data store for the system's most frequent and most sensitive interactions. Three representative flows will be documented: the athlete check-in flow, the application approval and athlete account creation flow, and the certificate request and issuance flow. Each diagram shows the controller, the service that owns the business rule, the notification or document action that follows, and the database tables touched.

In the **athlete check-in** flow, the athlete opens the Attendance Record page, the portal resolves the sessions visible to that athlete's sport, and the athlete submits a check-in. The attendance session service locks the session row, verifies that the session is open, not cancelled, and dated today, verifies that the athlete's assigned sport matches the session's effective sport, and then creates or updates the attendance record. The service resolves the status from the session's late grace period, storing Present when the check-in falls within the grace window and Late afterwards. A duplicate check-in is rejected with a clear message, and the Sports Coordinator is notified so that the roster updates in real time.

In the **application approval and athlete account creation** flow, the coordinator opens the application, reviews the three eligibility documents, and approves the application. The application controller records the decision, the review notes, and the reviewer's identity, and then creates the athlete account from the approved application, assigning the sport, generating the username and a one-time temporary password, and setting the must_change_password flag. The athlete is then notified through the in-app notification feed, and on first login the force-password-change middleware redirects the athlete to the change-password screen before any other portal page is reachable.

In the **certificate request and issuance** flow, the athlete requests a certificate for one of their achievements, which creates a Pending certificate request and notifies the coordinators. The coordinator approves the request, the certificate service assembles the official certificate payload — recipient, achievement, reference number, signatories, and issue date — and the PDF is rendered and stored on private storage. The coordinator then releases and issues the certificate, which updates the request to Issued and makes the file downloadable to the athlete from the Achievements page.
